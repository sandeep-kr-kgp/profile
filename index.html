    <div style="padding-left:10px;">Hi, my name is <b class="name">Sandeep</b> and here is some info about me
      <sup>v1</sup> :
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h4>The Summary</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Born on 1st of May, 1997 in a small village near Mathura, UP.</li>
        <li>At the age of 3, went to a sarkari school, got in a fight with someone and never went back to that
          school. Got homeschooled for around a year.</li>
        <li>At the age of 4, went to a private hindi medium UP board school which was located inside the village itself.
          Got admitted directly in the first class and studied there till class 4th.</li>
        <li>Switched to an english medium haryana board school in a nearby village. Had to repeat class 4th
          because I was not up to the English medium standards. </li>
        <li>3-4 years were complete shit, didn't like studying at all. For reference, got around 70% in
          8th.</li>
        <li>Got serious about studying because one of the class topper made fun of me. That sparked some kind of fire in
          me and I became really competitive.</li>
        <li>Got 96% in 10th. School topper and a record which remains unbroken till now.</li>
        <li>Got transferred to a CBSE school in a city for 11th and 12th. Stayed in a hostel. Coming from a small
          village, it took me one year to get acclamatized with the city lifestyle/environment. </li>
        <li>Went back to being casual and gave up studying. Scored 72% in 11th.</li>
        <li>Couldn't really muster up the motivation to study and started planning to join defence instead. Towards the
          end of 12th, for the first time I felt the pressure of what has everyone been expecting from me. Started
          studying for boards seriously when about 3 months were left. Got 87% somehow.</li>
        <li>While leaving the school, I was confused and didn't know what to do. One of my friends was going to Kota for
          JEE and I tagged along.</li>
        <li>Worked really hard, studied for maybe around 15hrs a day.</li>
        <li>Cleared JEE, and got admitted to IIT Kharagpur, Mechanical Engineering.</li>
        <li>Started participating in sports, politics, management etc. Basically everything other than studying
          engineering. </li>
        <li>Took up Athletics and stuck to it. Practiced for 2 hrs everyday without skipping a day.</li>
        <li>Passed out from college and started working as a software engineer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Personality</h4>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Okay, it might sound a bit complex at first but it's actually simple if you
        really think about it. Anyway
        here are the
        details:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Practical, straightforward, to the point, no bullshit kinda guy.</li>
        <li>Excellent sense of humor.</li>
        <li>Curious about everything that I don't know.</li>
        <li>Calm and composed almost always*. My feelings / emotions don't get affected much by what's going on
          around me.</li>
        <li>To me it doesn't matter what the problem is. All I think and care about is the solution. I believe in the
          fact that every problem has a solution and we just have to work towards it.</li>
        <li>I have a lot of patience and I am aware of the fact that good things take time. I would never give up unless
          I have achieved my goal. I don't care what it takes and how much sacrifices I have to make. I'll rather accept
          failure than not trying at all.</li>
        <li>I feel more comfortable when things are chaotic, unordered and problematic. I become highly focused in
          those situations.</li>
        <li>I am highly competitive and I like doing things that people consider tough. Like if someone told me that
          this thing is impossible then I might do that thing just to prove them wrong.</li>
        <li>Having been raised in a defence background, I like being punctual. I get really angry when someone says
          they'll do something at some specific time and they don't.</li>
        <li>I have a clear heart and would never wish anything bad for anyone. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h4>Some interesting things</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Learnt driving scooty in mountains, on my own.</li>
        <li>Scored 99.79 percentile in CAT after studying for 15 days.</li>
        <li>Learned coding in 3 months and got placed in campus placements in a software engineering role.</li>
        <li>Stayed awake for 5 days continuously without even a single hour of sleep.</li>
        <li>Can eat a 0.5Kg pineapple cake in one sitting.</li>
        <li>I don't use social media. I live in the real world.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h4>Things that I'm passionate about</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Coding : There're two reasons that I like coding, first one is money and the second one is that it
          provides me with the adrenaline hit. Inside my laptop it's like a different world where everything is
          structured, logical, everything's in my control and my laptop does exactly what I tell it to do, line by line
          step by step.</li>
        <li>Traveling : Every place has its unique vibe, culture and views. I want to explore as much as I can.
          I want to talk to localites, listen to their stories and learn their ways of life. It's just fascinating.</li>
        <li>DIY stuff : I like building things on my own. Maybe the mechanical engineer inside me is still alive.
        </li>
        <li>Gadgets : Well, I don't have any materialistic attachment but I do like to buy gadgets that add real
          value to my work or life AND if I feel that it's worth it. For example, I want to buy a telescope just because
          I want to look at the stars, planets with my own eyes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h4>Thing that I care about the most</h4>
      <div>
        Wanting to enjoy life and exploring the world is cool but for me the most important thing is betterment of
        family and the next generation. My parents sacrificed their ambitions for me and I can already feel that I'd
        do the same. Even if I could make their life better by 1% by sacrificing my own then I'd do it without any
        hesitation.
